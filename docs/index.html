		<h1>Selector Plugins</h1>
		<h2>Vendor Prefixed Pseudo Classes</h2>
		<p>Currently, the CSS specification allows for vendor prefixed pseudo-classes.  For the most part, 
		these are created by browser manufacturers to provide early implmentations of well discussed 
		proposals for addition into the next selectors draft.  If people like it, or if the rationale
		is strong enough, other browsers follow suit and work out the kinks each offering their own
		vendor prefixed version.   During this time, the API is arguably "unstable" or subject to change, 
		and users are warned.  Generally speaking, however, the community generally reaches wide enough
		concensus pretty quickly that the vast majority of use cases are covered and generalized 
		across the board pretty quickly.  At this point, however, it enters a different phase where 
	    the draft itself has to be created or finalized in committee and there, features can be 
	    changed, renamed, or even omitted/declined outright.  It is not until such a time as it looks
	    pretty inevitable that something will pass that browsers generally begin providing unprefixed
	    versions.
		</p>
		<h3>Advantages of the current system</h3>
		<p>There are advantages to the current system:
			<ul>
				<li>It prevents the kinds of browser wars which can create long term instability</li> 
				<li>Enusures a comparatively small, universal set which works everywhere.</li>
				<li>The intial implementor or two provide a great opt-in mechanism for CSS mavens to 
				try it out, comment on it, blog about it, etc.</li>
			</ul>		
		</p>
		
		<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
		<p>There are disadvantages to the current system as well:
			<ul>
				<li>Initial implementations are generally impractical for real world use, so the 
				testing is artifically limited to non-real world use cases.</li>
				<li>While ideas that pass the initial test catch on very quickly and get universally
				implemented by each vendor, the fact that a single invalid selector negates the entire
				rule means that the entire rule must be repeated with each of the vendor prefixes.
				Even using a pre-processor, we are faced with an artificially inflated and 
				impractically large stylesheet that needs to be delivered.  This also serves to 
				artifically limit the number of real-world uses where it can be used.</li>
				<li>The W3C and browser manufacturers, by their very nature, have to be concerned 
				with universality.  If something would be a major improvement for 80% of websites, 
				but if used on the remaining 20% would be distasterous - it is a non-starter.  While
				this seems like an advantage on its face</li>
			</ul>
		
		
		<p>Another disadvantage is that it limits innovation to the browser manufacturers and the 
		W3C committee whose concerns, by nature, have to be universal.  Whatever works for one kind
		of site or page has to work equally well for all.  This is kind of a shame because the Web 
		is a very diverse place and there are entire classes of potential solutions that would be
		great for the vast majority of pages, but entirely impractical in a small number of others.
		The later means that we are stuck with the least common denominator.</p>
